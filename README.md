## **Features**

### **1. Product(Bicycle) Management**

- Create, read, update, and delete bicycles.
- Store detailed information such as:
  - Name, brand, type, price, quantity, and availability (`inStock`).
- Validate bicycle data using Mongoose schema rules (e.g., positive prices, valid bicycle types).

### **2. User Management**

- User authentication with JWT (JSON Web Token).
- Role-based access control (Admin, Customer).
- Users can manage their profile, order history, and saved payment methods.
- min dashboard to manage users, orders, and product inventory.
- Dashboard , Checkout and Profile Setting are private routes user can use after login.

### **3. Order Management**

- Place orders and automatically update inventory levels.
- Prevent over-ordering with stock validation.
- Automatically set `inStock` to `false` when stock reaches zero.
- Update Order when payment successfully or cancel.
- Revenue is computed as the sum of all order quantities multiplied by bicycle prices.

### **4. Payment**

- Users can make payments via credit/debit cards.
- Secure online payments via Shurjo Payment integration.
- Users can make payments via credit/debit cards.
- Validate and verify successful payments.
- Maintain payment transaction history for each order.

### **5. Error Handling**

- Provide descriptive error messages for validation failures and operational issues.
- Handle errors consistently with centralized middleware.

### **6. Data Integrity**

- Enforce validation rules through Mongoose schemas (e.g., required fields, enum constraints, minimum values).
- Ensure relational consistency between orders and products using `ObjectId` references.
